Angle rotation is stored as int since i only saw whole numbers

When selecting a gameobject containing child rotators these ones would be selected as well

for the rotations settings part in the editor, setting to true the main toggle if it not already selected will set it to true along with the 3 sub-toggle and if set to true will deselect all of them.
If all of 3 sub-toggle are set to true it will set the main to true.
